Added initial version of search in `subscribe` operation.

Now you can type some part of show name and the bot will suggest you some suitable variants with inline buttons.
Also now you don't have to match case of the original show name − search is case insensitive.
For example, if you type `/subscribe newstudio marvel`, the bot will suggest you all shows with `marvel` (Marvel's Daredevil, Marvel's Jessica Jones, etc.) from `newstudio` show list.
But if there are too many suitable shows, the bot will suggest you clarify your request.
